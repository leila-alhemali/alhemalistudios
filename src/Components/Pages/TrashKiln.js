          Leila is interested in versions of the present day that were conceived
          in the past. During COVID, she spent a lot of time thinking about the
          visions for the 2020's that were constructed in the 1980's. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The design for the kiln came from the book "Ceramics with Space-Age
          Materials". It is constructed from an aluminum trash can lined with
          ceramic fiber. In Raku, pieces are taken from the kiln at high
          temperatures and quickly transferred into a reduction chamber.
